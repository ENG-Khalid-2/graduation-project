# 🎓 Graduation Project - The Vision of Blind People

This is my graduation project titled **"The Vision of Blind People"**.  
I was the team leader and responsible for managing and developing the core functionalities of the system.

## 📌 Project Idea
This project aims to help visually impaired individuals detect nearby objects using a camera and voice feedback.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Raspberry Pi 4
- Pi Camera Module
- YOLOv8 (Object Detection)
- Python + OpenCV
- Text-to-Speech (pyttsx3)

## 🖼️ Project Images

![Detection Sample](images/detection.jpg)

## 🧪 How it Works
1. The camera captures real-time video.
2. YOLO model detects objects.
3. The system announces the object using audio.

## 📦 Installation
```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install ultralytics
pip install pyttsx3
